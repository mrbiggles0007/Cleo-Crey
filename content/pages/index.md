      This is my journey of progress from the relationship that led me to this

      This will be undertaken with either weekly or if there is nothing to

    title: Background On How I Got Here
    subtitle: >-
      I fell in love when I was 26 with a girl named Chloe & married her before
      divorcing 7 Years ago now and becoming close friends. The friendship ended
      & I made this site to help focus on recovering from the pain involved. I
      will be using videos to cover my story.

        content: >
          It is hard to admit as a man to being cheated on. When someone who you
          share your life with betrays you in this way, the heartbreak is unlike
          anything else I have experienced. The video below details when it
          happened & how I worked through it. The two worst parts for me were
          that Cleo my wife at the time had taken the time to develop a code
          with him so that if I looked at her phone, I would not be suspicious.


          The second was not only having something so horrendous happen but then
          be blamed for causing it because I did not give her enough attention.
          Not even the integrity to take accountability for the actions.

      This is my journey of progress from the relationship that led me to this
      point & my decision to make a change and get my life back on track.


      This will be undertaken with either weekly or if there is nothing to
      report, monthly videos of my experience on getting my life back.

    title: Background On How I Got Here
    subtitle: >-
      I fell in love when I was 26 with a girl named Chloe & married her before
      divorcing 7 Years ago now and becoming close friends. The friendship ended
      & I made this site to help focus on recovering from the pain involved. I
      will be using videos to cover my story.

          It is hard to admit as a man to being cheated on. When someone who you
          share your life with betrays you in this way, the heartbreak is unlike
          anything else I have experienced. The video below details when it
          happened & how I worked through it. The two worst parts for me were
          that Cleo my wife at the time had taken the time to develop a code
          with him so that if I looked at her phone, I would not be suspicious.


          The second was not only having something so horrendous happen but then
          be blamed for causing it because I did not give her enough attention.
          Not even the integrity to take accountability for the actions.
